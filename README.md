Prototypes and stuff


# Prototype 1 - **Car game**  
Very basic movement and camera control  
  
# Prototype 2 - **Feeding Frenzy Game**  
*Feed the animals before they stampede over you!*  
Use A-D to move left right, shift to dash, space to throw pizza. Don't waste any pizza, there's a cooldown!  
Use the debug log to check your score at the end.
## Challenge 2
Mostly as specified in https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/challenge-2-play-fetch-with-random-values-and-arrays but uses mutex to lock spawning until previous object is removed  
*Might try to make dog run back after obtaining ball/reaching end of screen*

# Personal Project  
Third person perspective with movement and camera control  
Sketchy pause menu  
**TO DO** Fix menu, add buttons  

# Prototype 3 - **Jump Game**  
Jumping was more complicated than needed.  
Added hold time to jump and waits until landing until player can jump again.  
Slightly clunky because jump only happens after release or 2 seconds.  
*Note: UNITY (+ most games) use polling instead of interrupts!!*  
**TODO**  
    Finish game  
    Make jump similar to Mario (lower gravity while jump is held?)  

# Prototype 4 - **Sumo**  

# Prototype 5 - **Clicky Consumables**  
Learning about UI.
